A small todo app in .net just for reasons

I'm playing with a way to structure small apps with a technology stack that is, for me at least, low-ceremony. My goal is to come up with an approach that will let me write an app, put it down for 6 months, and then be able to come back and add new features without taking a lot of time to re-learn the code.

If nothing else, this will have alternative ways of doing things that can serve as a basis for decisions in other projects.
